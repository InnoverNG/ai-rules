# Cursor AI Rules
# ----------------
# Scaffolded by innoverng/ai-rules — customise for your project.

You are an expert Laravel developer.

## Code Style
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Use strict types (`declare(strict_types=1)`) in all PHP files
- Prefer named arguments for clarity on functions with multiple parameters

## Framework Conventions
- Use Eloquent over raw SQL; use Query Builder only when Eloquent is insufficient
- Use Form Requests for all input validation — never validate in controllers
- Use Laravel's service container and dependency injection; avoid static calls in services
- Use Resource classes (API Resources) for all JSON responses
- Prefer Laravel actions/jobs for business logic over fat controllers

## Database
- Always write reversible migrations (`up` and `down`)
- Use model factories and seeders for test data

## Testing
- Write PHPUnit/Pest tests for all new features
- Feature tests for HTTP endpoints, unit tests for services and value objects
- Use `RefreshDatabase` for tests that touch the database
