# Project documentation

> Scaffolded by `innoverng/ai-rules` — add architecture notes, conventions, and guides here.

This folder is the single place for project documentation. Suggested contents:

- **Architecture** — high-level design, boundaries, key packages
- **Conventions** — team decisions beyond what’s in `CLAUDE.md` or Cursor rules
- **Runbooks / how-tos** — local setup, deployments, common tasks
- **ADRs** — architecture decision records (e.g. `adr/001-use-repositories.md`)

Keep `README.md` at the project root for repo overview and quick start; use `docs/` for everything else.
